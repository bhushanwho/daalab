/*

    the root-leaf path problem
    is quite literally

    a generalization of the hamiltonian cycles problem,
    but you don't traverse through each and every node. 

    instead, you go on until you find the "end", or a NULL child.

    it is a disguised simpligied backtracking problem.
    study Hamiltonian Cycle with Backtracking, you'll hit 2 birds with one stone.
